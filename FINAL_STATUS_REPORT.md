## 🚀 **How to Use the System**

### **Option 1: Use the JavaFX Interface** (Currently Running)
**What Works:**
- ✅ View dashboard statistics
- ✅ Browse all products in the list
- ✅ Search and filter products
- ✅ Sort products by any column
- ✅ View product details

**Current Limitation:**
- ⚠️ Add/Edit product dialogs have FXML issues

### **Option 2: Use the API Documentation** (Recommended for Add/Edit)
**Perfect for CRUD operations:**

1. **Open Swagger UI**: http://localhost:8000/docs
2. **Interactive API Testing**: Test all endpoints
3. **Add Products**: Use POST /products endpoint
4. **Edit Products**: Use PUT /products/{id} endpoint
5. **Delete Products**: Use DELETE /products/{id} endpoint
6. **View Results**: Refresh JavaFX window to see changes

**Example: Add a Product via API**
```json
POST http://localhost:8000/products
{
  "name": "New Product",
  "category": "Electronics",
  "quantity": 50,
  "price": 299.99,
  "description": "A new product added via API"
}
```

### **Option 3: Direct API Calls**
Use curl or Postman:
```bash
# Add product
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/products \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Test Product","category":"Electronics","quantity":10,"price":99.99,"description":"Test"}'

# Get all products
curl http://localhost:8000/products

# Update product
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8000/products/1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Updated Name","quantity":20}'

# Delete product
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/products/31
```
